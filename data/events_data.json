In this session, you will build, write and draw in your own Minecraft map. Don‚Äôt worry you don‚Äôt need to own or know how to play the game - we will only use it as a visual representation of our Infrastructure. If you happen to own the game you can use the client to log in to the server we provide. At the end of the session, you should know:  * What are Resources and States * How and when to use variables and locals * How to create and manage resources * How to use functions and meta-arguments * How to write and use Terraform modules  No previous experience is necessary. If you are already a terraform guru - at the end of the session, we encourage everyone to build something cool - that will be your time to shine!  Agenda (in-person, stream will start at 18:30): 18:00 - Doors open, time to settle in and grab a drink! 18:30 - Start of the session 20:00 - Time for the pizza and networking 21:00 - The end  For those coming to our meet-up for the first time, we believe in learning by doing so please bring a laptop with you! The session will start with a short presentation introducing the topic and lead into a one-hour-long hands-on lab. We will provide an environment for you, so anything with the web browser from this century should be sufficient!",

        "description": "Presenter: Philip Walton - https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-walton-b4449b240/  NGINX is the most popular web server with over 25% of the market share! In the words of the creators:  NGINX is open-source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers. source: https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/  It is a powerful tool and due to its popularity, it is difficult to find someone from the tech industry who never heard of it!This will be an introductory-level look at some features of NGINX. In this session you will learn:  how to configure NGINX as a web-server, next, we will make it work as load-balancer then configure it as reverse-proxy to a REST API finally how to set it up as an API Gateway to multiple micro-services. At the end of this session, you should know enough about basic functionality to start exploring more complex use cases!

This month thanks to Matt and Olwen we will learn how to do it right!  What we‚Äôll do: We‚Äôll be setting up a Cucumber-JVM framework from scratch, making a GET, POST, PUT and DELETE request and putting in some Cucumber data-table transforms, with this we‚Äôll parse some JSON responses, both simple and nested JSON.  What we‚Äôll learn out of it: You‚Äôll learn how to set up a JVM framework, create a Cucumber table that transforms and test an open source API. You‚Äôll also learn how to interact with JSON, both simple and nested.
